            <p class = "text"> <b>Jerry Smith</b> is one of the main characters of Rick and Morty. Jerry is the husband of Beth Smith, the father of Summer Smith and Morty Smith, and the son-in-law of Rick Sanchez. The first six episodes of season 1 featured Jerry Smith (Cronenberged dimension), while the current Jerry was born in and inhabits the Replacement dimension.

                Jerry is often noted as somewhat of a loser. He constantly attempts to find a career to no avail, leaving his wife Beth to be the breadwinner of the family. However, he is capable of heroism in times of crisis and has saved his family's lives on a few occasions. Jerry's marriage to Beth is often rocky and unstable, resulting in the two finally getting a divorce in the Season 3 premiere. Jerry would spend most of the season living alone and depressed in a small apartment, until he and Beth reconcile in the Season 3 finale, although it's currently unknown if the Beth he re-married is a clone or the original Beth.
                
                Jerry also has an adversarial relationship with his father-in-law, Rick and he often competes with the latter for the admiration of his family. However, that hasn't stopped Jerry from becoming more involved in Rick's space adventures. Currently, Jerry has also taken up beekeeping and produces his own honey.</p>
