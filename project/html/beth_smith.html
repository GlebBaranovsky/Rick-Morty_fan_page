            <p class = "text"> <b>Bethany "Beth" Smith</b> (n√©e Sanchez) is one of the main characters of Rick and Morty. She is the daughter of Rick Sanchez and Mrs. Sanchez/Diane Sanchez, the wife of Jerry Smith, and the mother of Summer Smith and the deceased Morty Smith. She currently acts as the mother and the daughter of the Morty Smith and Rick Sanchez from the Cronenberged dimension, respectively. She also works as a veterinarian at the St. Equis Hospital.
                Characterized by a superiority complex and abandonment issues, Beth gradually came to struggle with her husband over his contributions to their marriage, due in part to his lower-level position and subsequent employment, further driven by her father influencing her feelings of superiority. The two eventually divorced, before reuniting in the Season 3 finale.
                
                Around the same time, Beth grappled with the decision to leave her family in order to find herself or stay on Earth. She ended up leaving Rick to decide for her. Rick decided to create a clone of Beth and randomly sent one Beth to space whilst leaving the other on Earth, leaving it unknown to both Rick and the audience which Beth is the clone.</p>
