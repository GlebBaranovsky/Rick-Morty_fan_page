            <p class = "text"> <b>Summer Smith</b> is the deuteragonist of Rick and Morty, as a member of the Smith Family. She is the daughter of Jerry Smith and Beth Smith/Space Beth, the older sister of Morty Smith, and the mother of Naruto Smith.
                She currently acts as the older sister and the granddaughter of the Morty and Rick, respectively, from the Cronenberged Dimension and Dimension C-137. She is the only other known member of the the Smith Family to be aware of that fact.[1] As the series has progressed, Summer has become more frequently involved in Rick and Morty's adventures. She and Morty often squabble for Rick's affection, but also maintain a unique bond stemming from the revelation that Morty is not her original brother.</p>
