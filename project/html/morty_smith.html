            <p class = "text"> <b>Mortimer "Morty" Smith Sr.</b> is one of the two titular main protagonists (alongside Rick Sanchez) of Rick and Morty.
                He is the grandson of Rick and is often forced to tag along on his various misadventures. Morty attends Harry Herpson High School along with his sister, Summer. At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly anxious and submissive teenage boy. However, after going on many so-called adventures with Rick, Morty has seemingly become more confident and his own person, independent from Rick, rather than a mere sidekick.
                
                He is voiced by Justin Roiland.</p>
