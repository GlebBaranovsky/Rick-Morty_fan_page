            <p class = "text"> <b>Rick Sanchez</b>, also known as Rick (C-137), is one of the titular two main protagonists (alongside Morty Smith) of the science fiction adult animated comedy series Rick and Morty.

                He is a megagenius scientist whose alcoholism and reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his "daughter's" family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty. Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental health were large sources of speculation. As time has gone on, more has been revealed about his character, his backstory explaining much of his behaviour. At the same time, Rick has continuously committed more heinous acts, certifying him as the series' anti-hero, bordering on antagonist.
                
                He is voiced by Justin Roiland.</p>
